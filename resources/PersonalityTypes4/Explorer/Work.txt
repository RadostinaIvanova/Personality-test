Work: Explorers are highly spontaneous, connecting with their environment in a way that’s almost childlike in its wonder and sheer fun. But when they need to work on something that’s frustrating or unexciting – well, that can prove something of a challenge.This may show up in how Explorer personality types approach their academic and professional lives. Explorers are slightly less likely than other Roles to say that they developed productive work habits in school. y’re also less likely to say that it was easy for them to do well in school. Many school environments are relatively prescriptive, filled with required courses and standardized curricula. As a result, Explorer personalities often find themselves forced to sit through classes that just don’t excite them – which, for these types, can be unmotivating. Unfortunately, this can persist in their professional lives as well – after all, most jobs require at least some degree of routine, unglamorous work.
