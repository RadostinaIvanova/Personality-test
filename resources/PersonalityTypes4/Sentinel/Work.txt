That said, Sentinels are hardly unimaginative. They simply take inspiration from the past rather than the future. These personality types remain loyal to established best practices and traditions,  whether that’s the best way to make a pizza crust or the most efficient way to write an algorithm. This enables them to make steady, consistent progress – which is exactly what they enjoy. entinels would much rather guide a single project to completion than start (and abandon) a flurry of interesting ideas. Sentinel personalities thrive in environments that have clear hierarchies and rules. Whether or not they’re in a formal leadership role, they care about setting a good example, and they gain great satisfaction from guiding a well-functioning group. This can make them excellent teachers, managers, and community officials, as well as caring parents and hosts.
