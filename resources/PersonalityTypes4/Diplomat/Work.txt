Work: If your life goals are to earn pots of money, land an impressive job, buy a fancy car, and be better than everyone else – well, you’re probably not a Diplomat.But that isn’t to say that Diplomats don’t have their own type of ambition. 85% of Diplomats say it’s important to them to make a lasting impact on other people, outside of their family and closest friends. In other words, these personality types want to make a lasting difference in the world – which is no small feat. This might explain why Diplomats are second only to Analysts in saying that they sometimes set impossibly high standards for themselves.Only few of Diplomats say their career is the most important thing in their lives. Perhaps because they have such a lofty view of success, Diplomats are the Role least likely to consider themselves successful. It’s important to note that the great majority of people with these personality types still say they’d be upset if they never became successful. As a result, many people with these types may feel as constantly striving toward ideals and expectations that they’ll never meet.To address this sense of inadequacy, many Diplomats find they must let go of comparisons to other people. Most of the Diplomats say they consciously compare themselves to others either often or very often.By releasing these comparisons, Diplomats can free themselves to do things their own way, in their own time – rather than fretting over whether they’re successful yet.
