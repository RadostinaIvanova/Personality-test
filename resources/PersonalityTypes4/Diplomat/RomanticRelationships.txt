Romantic Relationships: For Diplomats, authenticity and connection aren’t just buzzwords. These concepts which might seem vague or wishy-washy to other types form the bedrock of Diplomats’ lives. This explains why relationships matter so much to these personality types – and not just any type of relationship, but rather real, meaningful bonds.When asked about their ideal social life, only small percentage of Diplomats would like to spend most of their time alone. Instead, the majority of Diplomats express a desire for a partner and a few good friends. These personalities may also worry more about loneliness than other types, with nearly two thirds of Diplomats saying they worry about being lonely in their old age.
